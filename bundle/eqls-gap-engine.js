/* eqls-gap-engine - Session E (EQLS Residual)
 *
 * Built to docs/BUNDLE-CONTRACT.md (Session A, 31 Aug 2026), eql-source
 * claude/bundle-contract @ 2bd70807. Read from the file, not from a summary.
 *
 * A classic script, one file, no imports. Registers exactly two properties on
 * one global and touches nothing else.
 *
 * PROHIBITED BY SECTION 3 AND ABSENT BY CONSTRUCTION: fetch, XMLHttpRequest,
 * WebSocket, sendBeacon, EventSource, document, localStorage, sessionStorage,
 * IndexedDB, cookies, setTimeout, setInterval, requestAnimationFrame, eval,
 * new Function. bundle/check-bundle.js fails the build if any appears.
 *
 * ENCODING IS NOT MINE. Section 2: `lines` are already-decoded strings.
 * A owns detection and recovery, and A measured the half nobody had: a browser
 * TextDecoder('utf-8',{fatal:true}) throws where Node substitutes U+FFFD
 * silently. So this file assumes nothing and checks nothing about bytes. If a
 * replacement character reaches here it is A's defect, stated by A.
 *
 * This is a port of gapengine.py. The two are kept honest by bundle/parity.py,
 * which runs both over the same log and diffs the Reports field by field.

  // 1.1.0, 31 Aug 2026 -- MINOR, not patch and not major. The `Report` SHAPE is
  // unchanged, so per BUNDLE-CONTRACT section 6 the page still knows how to render
  // it and must not refuse. What changed is behaviour a consumer can observe: a
  // Report that previously carried `refusals: []` on a log with no outgoing damage
  // now carries the three unconditional ones. Strictly additive -- fields the page
  // already renders, in a case where it previously rendered none.
  // NOT the repository's version. sky-ledger also carries a git tag v1.1.0
  // (ad4f2a70, the Sky Ledger Windows release, 100,482,932 bytes, and the site's
  // published download link is pinned to it). This field is EQLSGapEngine's, per
  // BUNDLE-CONTRACT section 2. Say "EQLSGapEngine 1.1.0", never "sky-ledger 1.1.0".
  // 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0, 1 Sep 2026, RULED by the Director and not taken unilaterally.
  // TWO byte-sets shipped as 1.2.0 within one night -- d6e17bec (20,337 b, B's pin)
  // and 32a50df4 (25,443 b) -- and the second changed the PARSER: a self-hit guard on
  // the melee branch and a day-of-month class that accepts a space-padded day. B's
  // guard asserts version === "1.2.0" exactly and refuses a newer engine as readily
  // as an older one, so B's pin could not tell the fixed engine from the broken one.
  // That is the failure the pin exists to prevent, and it was mine to fix at source.
  // MINOR, not MAJOR: no key was removed, renamed or retyped, and `measured.window`
  // and `coverage.self_damage_excluded` are additive. Values a consumer reads CAN
  // change for the same log -- that is the point of the fix -- but semver governs the
  // shape of the contract, not bug-for-bug stability of the numbers.
  // B'S EXACT-EQUALITY GUARD MEANS B MUST RE-PIN TO READ THIS. That is B's design and
  // B's call; it is named in HANDOFF.md's STATUS block as REPIN NEEDED so the
  // divergence cannot sit undeclared. check_contract.py fails if it ever does.
  // 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0, 1 Sep 2026. `measured.window.endpoint` is additive: the engaged
  // denominator's convention, and the MEASURED size of choosing it -- 14.04% on the
  // log this engine was built against, 2.24% to 13.79% on three others, refused below
  // 30 inter-hit gaps. No existing value moves and `dps` is unchanged.
  // THIS FORCES B'S SECOND RE-PIN IN AN HOUR and that cost is named rather than
  // avoided: the alternative was hiding a computed figure inside an existing string,
  // which is a loophole in the rule that a changed bundle needs a changed version,
  // and a number in prose is one a consumer cannot compute against. Declared as
  // REPIN NEEDED: 1.4.0 in HANDOFF.md; check_contract.py fails without it.
  // 1.4.0 -> 1.5.0, 1 Sep 2026. `coverage.parse` is additive and answers R159's
  // question: what KIND of claim is this evidence for. A file that could not be read
  // and a character who dealt no damage used to produce the same output, and that is
  // how the CRLF defect stayed quiet -- a true sentence about an unread file, in the
  // slot where a measurement goes. Now three verdicts and three sentences.
  // IF B IS STILL ON 1.3.0, GO STRAIGHT TO 1.5.0 AND SKIP 1.4.0 -- one re-pin, not
  // two. Both changes are needed; neither is skippable in substance.

  // B's contract names that exact division -- damage_dealt is "the denominator for
  // share-of-output". 324% on the short log, 34% and 0% on two outside logs, so the
  // error is not a constant a reader could learn to subtract. No value moves: the
  // report states its populations and publishes the totals. Rescoping was the wrong
